<b>MeowChatBox</b> is a WebRTC browser-to-browser chat application. <br>
It is currently 100% working  both Chrome as well as Firefox in online mode. It works in both desktop as well as in mobile (it's fast in Android). I haven't checked with Opera. <br>
But, it never works in IE. <br>
<br>
For Demo:- <a href="http://www.windowsgeekpro.in/MeowChatBox/chat.html">CLICK HERE</a> <br>
<br>
Note: Be careful with the messages you send, it will be saved in my database server.
<br>
<br>
You can also build your own... <br>
1. Clone it using npm 
```
$git clone https://github.com/ashumeow/MeowChatBox.git
```
or <br>
2. Directly download from master -- <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/MeowChatBox/archive/master.zip">click here</a> <br>
<br>
For running the file in static mode/offline, it works only in Firefox:- <br>
Open <code>chat.html</code> and if it works, then modify it or build more with it and use it for your own project or for any right purpose. <br>
